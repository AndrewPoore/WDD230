            Bogus Basin Mountain Recreation Area is a ski area in Boise County, Idaho, sixteen road miles
            north-northeast of the city of Boise. Bogus is operated by the Bogus Basin Recreation Association, a
            non-profit organization, on private and leased land in the Boise National Forest. Ski
            season generally runs from Thanksgiving weekend until the weekend preceding April 15, depending on snow
            conditions. The area also has cross-country skiing on 23 miles of Nordic trails. The area probably got its
            name during the 19th-century gold rush. Crooks in the hills above Boise City, known as "spelterers", would
            make bogus gold dust by heating lead filings with a bit of real gold dust.

            The Sawtooth Range is a mountain range of the Rocky Mountains in central Idaho, United States, reaching a
            maximum elevation of 10,751 feet at the summit of Thompson Peak. It encompasses an area of 678
            square miles spanning parts of Custer, Boise, Blaine, and Elmore counties, and is bordered to
            the east by the Sawtooth Valley. Much of the mountain range is within the Sawtooth Wilderness, part of the
            Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Sawtooth National Forest. The mountains were named for their jagged
            peaks

            <h4>Population: 922</h4><br>
            Challis is the largest city in Custer County, Idaho, United States. It is the county seat and its population
            was 1,081 at the 2010 census. The 2020 census shows 902 residents, a 16.6% drop. Challis was founded in 1878
            and named for A.P. Challis, who was a surveyor when the townsite was laid out. Challis post office was
            established in 1878. Twin Peaks Sports, the I.O.O.F. Hall, and a number of other buildings in Challis are
            individually listed on
            the National Register of Historic Places, most as a result of an Idaho State Historical Society study of
            historical resources in the town.

            Stanley is a town in the Sawtooth Valley in Custer County, Idaho, United States. The population was 116 at
            the 2020 census; up from 63 in 2010. The center of population of Idaho in 2000 was located in Stanley. Fur
            trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company discovered the Stanley Basin in the 1820s, but it was mostly avoided
            due to scarcity of beaver. Captain John Stanley, a Confederate Civil War veteran, led a party of
            twenty-three prospectors through the area in 1863, but they found little gold and moved on and
            discovered the Atlanta lode on the south end of the Sawtooths. The site was not considered a town until 1919
            when its streets and lots were surveyed and recorded.
